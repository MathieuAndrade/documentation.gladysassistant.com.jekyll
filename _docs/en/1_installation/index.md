Gladys is a small server written in Node.js. It's built to run on Linux, Windows or Mac. But I recommend running Gladys on a Raspberry Pi.

The Raspberry Pi is a small computer, which works amazingly for home control, it is :

*   Affordable (35$)
*   Quiet (no fan)
*   Low power consumption
*   Powerful (1.2GHz 64-bit quad-core ARMv8 CPU, 1Go RAM)
*   All connectivities are built-in (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1 LE, Ethernet, 40 GPIO pins, 4 ports USB, Full HDMI port)

If you don't have one, just get started with a [Raspberry Pi starter kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01C6Q2GSY/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=gladproj-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01C6Q2GSY&linkId=8cf1724b55f8212f6525f60ea55975af).
